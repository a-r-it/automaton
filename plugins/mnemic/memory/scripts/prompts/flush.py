_TEMPLATE = """Review the conversation context below and respond with a concise summary
of important items that should be preserved in the daily log.
Do NOT use any tools — just return plain text.

Format your response as a structured daily log entry with these sections:

**Context:** [One line about what the user was working on]

**Key Exchanges:**
- [Important Q&A or discussions]

**Decisions Made:**
- [Any decisions with rationale]

**Lessons Learned:**
- [Gotchas, patterns, or insights discovered]

**Action Items:**
- [Follow-ups or TODOs mentioned]

Skip anything that is:
- Routine tool calls or file reads
- Content that's trivial or obvious
- Trivial back-and-forth or clarification exchanges

Only include sections that have actual content. If nothing is worth saving,
respond with exactly: FLUSH_OK

## Conversation Context
